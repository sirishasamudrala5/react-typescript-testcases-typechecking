## Tasks

### Task 1

Each file has tests that are empty. Fill each test out to match what is expected.

Run `yarn test` to test.

### Task 2

Inside of `reducers/sample.ts`, you will see `type SampleAction = unknown`.

Fix this type to be specific to the actions available. Please make the type as accurate as possible.

Run `yarn typecheck` to test.
